## Context
I have many past projects and pieces of work that I have made architectural decisions for.  The process for making these decisions has not been consistent and has led to problems like:

- Forgetting the justification for decisions, leading to retreads and time loss.
- Decisions not being understood when they are revisited, resulting in extra time being needed to rediscover the facts.
- Not following compliance required as a result of the decision, leading to further tasks to correct work that was thought to be complete.

<br>

## Decision
Architectural Decision Records will be used from 2023 onwards.  This will provide a framework for every decision and can be referenced in documentation, blog posts and other ADRs.

---
## Compliance

- ADRs to be written in and saved as Markdown.
- ADRs to be saved with filename of **Reference** (see below).
- ADRs to be spell checked before release.
- ADRs with `Superseded` or `Retired` statuses must be moved from the repo/hot storage to cold storage.

<br>

Each ADR will be written as follows:

- **Reference** consists of:

- **Classification** is based on ADR's information sensitivity:
  - Confidential: No public access.  Store locally with password.
  - Private: No public access.  Store locally.
  - Public: No access limitations.  Store on GitHub.

  - CAR (Core & Finance)
  - LEI (Leisure)
  - PER (Personal)
  - WAA (Work & Academia)

<br>

- Category the ADR rests in.  There is no list of these but commonalities will emerge over time.

<br>

- **Status**: The ADR's status:
  - `Dev`: ADR is in development.
  - `Live`: ADR is Live.

  - `Superseded`: ADR has been superseded by a newer version.  In **Filename**, `Latest` must be replaced with the date the ADR was superseded.

> **Each status change must be recorded in `DATES`.**

<br>

- **Dates**

## Consequences - Positive
- ADRs are commonly used in the IT industry and have agreed layouts and applications.
- Permanent records will exist of all decisions.
- Each decision will have a framework to follow to help prevent factors being missed.
- ADRs will self-document compliance and guidelines.
 
<br>

## Consequences - Negative
- Time will need to be made for each document.  Guidance suggests this should be no more than 60 minutes.
- Time will need to be spent verifying that each ADR meets the standards of this one.
